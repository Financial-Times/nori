  exploratory CLI tool to make changes across multiple repositories & track their progress
</p>

---

Nori is a command-line application for managing changes across multiple (usually Github) repositories. It allows you to build up a sequence of [**Operations**](#operations) to go through the process of discovering repositories to change, cloning them & making the changes, creating Pull Requests for the changes, and tracking the progress of the Pull Requests in a Github Project. The main interface for Nori is an interactive command-line wizard, which prompts you for which operations to run, and the arguments needed for each operation.

## Usage

```sh
npx nori
```

This temporarily installs Nori and runs the interactive wizard. The first time you run it, it will prompt you for various [configuration variables](#configuration), which are required only for certain operations. It'll then ask you to `Create a session`. Give the session a memorable name. The wizard takes you through the operations you can run. At any point you can exit by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> or selecting `Done`. Your progress is saved under the name you gave when you started `nori`. Next time you run it, it will display a list of previous sessions that you can resume, most recent last.

If you'll be running `nori` frequently, install it globally:

```sh
npm install -g nori
```

## Operations

### Tako

Get a list of repositories from a [Tako](https://github.com/financial-times/tako) instance.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Arguments</th>
    <td><code>topic</code></td>
    <td>(optional) Github topic to filter the repositories by</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Inputs</th>
    <td colspan="2"><em>none</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Output</th>
    <td colspan="2"><code>repos</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### File

Get a list of repositories from a text file, structured as line-separated `owner/name` strings (optionally with leading `https://github.com/).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Arguments</th>
    <td><code>file</code></td>
    <td>path to the text file to read, relative to the current working directory</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Inputs</th>
    <td colspan="2"><em>none</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Output</th>
    <td colspan="2"><code>repos</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### File

Filter the list of repositories by their names.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Arguments</th>
    <td><code>filter</code></td>
    <td>regular expression to filter the names of the repos by</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Inputs</th>
    <td colspan="2"><em>repos</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Output</th>
    <td colspan="2"><code>repos</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Run Script

Clone each of the list of repositories, create a branch, run a script on that branch, then push the branch to the remote.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="right" rowspan="2">Arguments</th>
    <td><code>script</code></td>
    <td>path to the script to run, relative to the current working directory. should have executable permissions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>branch</code></td>
    <td>name of the branch to create</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Inputs</th>
    <td colspan="2"><em>repos</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Output</th>
    <td colspan="2"><code>branches</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**NB** *this operation will be split into multiple operations. it's doing too much right now*

The script has the responsibility to:

- Make changes to the files in a local clone of a git repository
- Add those changes to git
- Commit those changes to git

Nori will take care of:

- Cloning the repos
- Creating branches
- Pushing branches

The main benefit of this approach is that scripts do not _need_ the
`transformation-runner` for you to be able to run them. This makes development,
debugging and one-off runs of a script much simpler.

### Pull Requests

Create a Pull Request for each of the pushed branches.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="right" rowspan="2">Arguments</th>
    <td><code>title</code></td>
    <td>the title of the pull requests. you can use Javascript <code>${}</code> template string syntax. available variables are <code>repo.owner</code>, <code>repo.name</code> and <code>branch</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>body</code></td>
    <td>the body of the pull requests. supports templates like <code>title</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Inputs</th>
    <td colspan="2"><em>repos</em>, <em>branches</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Output</th>
    <td colspan="2"><code>prs</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Project

Create a Github Project, and add all created Pull Requests to it.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="right" rowspan="2">Arguments</th>
    <td><code>name</code></td>
    <td>the name of the project to create</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>org</code></td>
    <td>the org to create the project in. this must be the same org as every repo that you've created a PR on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Inputs</th>
    <td colspan="2"><em>prs</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="right">Output</th>
    <td colspan="2"><code>project</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**NB** *we're considering what to do about repos from multiple orgs #62*

**NB** *the project will have `To Do`, `In Progress` and `Done` columns, but there's currently no way to set up automatic transitions using the Github API*
